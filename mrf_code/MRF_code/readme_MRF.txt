Disclaimer:
Please report any bugs to onnela@hsph.harvard.edu. You can also send any
comments and suggestions about the program.

Note that the program is expecting a friendly use, with input files arranged
in folders as described below, and does not do much verification of the
input files.

This package provides the Matlab function MRF.m to calculate the mesoscopic
response function of a network (or group of networks), which are based on
the network's community structure. MRF.m finds communities by calling three
programs (convert, community, and hierarchy) which implement the
Louvain method introduced by Blondel et al. (2008). These files are
generated by a modified version of the C++ implementation of the Louvain
method written by E. Lefebvre and adapted by J.-L. Guillaume. The original
version of the code is available at http://www.lambiotte.be/codes.html. We
use a C++ implementation of the community detection algorithm because of its
computational efficiency.

The sequence of actions to use MRF.m is as follows:

1. Compile the C++ files included in this distribution. See the file
readme.txt written by E. Lefebvre for more details of these files.

2. Create a directory called "adj_dir" to store the adjacency matrices for
all of the networks that you wish to investigate. The networks should be
stored in this folder in .mat format as (possibly sparse) NXN adjacency
matrices, where N is the number of nodes in the network. MRFs are only
defined for undirected directs; however, MRF.m will create undirected
networks from any directed graphs by simply symmetrizing the adjacency
matrix. The networks may be weighted, but the link weights must be positive.

3. Run MRF.m. This will calculate and plot MRFs for all of the networks
stored in "adj_dir". In addition, if "adj_dir" contains the adjacency matrices
of more than one network, MRF.m calculates the pairwise distances
between all of the networks in "adj_dir". The function then creates the folder
"MRF_stats" and saves the files "MRF_curves.mat" and "MRF_distances.mat"
in this folder. The former .mat file contains data for the MRF curves for
all of the networks in "adj_dir", and the latter file stores the pairwise
distances between the MRFs.
